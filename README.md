# fastmapper
This is a command line utility for quickly mapping a set of addresses.

Begin by setting up a [Google Maps API
key](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key) and
saving it as a text file in the working directory. Then enter the
addresses you would like to map in the format as shown:

```
name,street,city,state,zip
Tmobile Park,1250 1st Ave S,Seattle,WA,98134
CenturyLink Field,800 Occidental Ave S, Seattle, WA,98134
Key Arena,305 Harrison St, Seattle, WA,98109
McCarthey Center,801 N Cincinnati St, Spokane, WA,99258
```

Run the main command and watch as the mapped addresses appear in a new
browser window.
